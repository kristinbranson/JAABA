%   windowFeatureNames2Codes(featureNames,perframeFeatureNames,statNames,transNames)
% 
% Computes a compact code version of window feature names.
% Inputs:
% featureNames: featureNames{i} is a cell array with arguments defining 
% window feature i
% Optional: perframeFeatureNames, statNames, transNames: these are cell
% arrays with the names of per frame features, window statistics, and
% window transform types. Columns of the code are indices into these cells.
% If these arguments are not given, or are empty cells, then they are set
% to an alphabetical list of all per frame features, window statistics, and
% window transforms in featureNames (via the unique function). 
% Outputs:
% featureCodes: featureCodes(i,:) is the code describing window feature i.
% perframeFeatureNames, statNames, transNames: cells defining the lookup codes
% for the names of per frame features, window statistics, and window
% transform types. 
% Note that if new window feature parameter types are added to window
% features, they need to be added here! The only ones I think exist are
% change_window_radius and num_harmonic.
