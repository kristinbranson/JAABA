MATLAB Compiler

1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

. Verify the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 7.17 (R2012a).   

. If the MCR is not installed, do following:
  (1) enter
  
      >>mcrinstaller
      
      at MATLAB prompt. This MCR Installer command displays the 
      location of the MCR Installer.

  (2) run the MCR Installer.

Or download Linux 64bit version of MCR from the MathWorks website:

   http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/
   
   
For more information about the MCR and the MCR Installer, see 
“Working With the MCR” in the MATLAB Compiler User’s Guide.    


2. Files to Deploy and Package

Files to package for Standalone 
================================
-JAABA_linux 
-run_JAABA_linux.sh (shell script run to temporarily set environment variables and 
                     execute the application)
   -to run the shell script, type
   
       ./run_JAABA_linux.sh <mcr_directory> <argument_list>
       
    at Linux or Mac command prompt. <mcr_directory> is the directory 
    where version 7.17 of MCR is installed or the directory where 
    MATLAB is installed on the machine. <argument_list> is all the 
    arguments you want to pass to your application. For example, 

    If you have version 7.17 of MCR installed in 
    /mathworks/home/application/v717, run the shell script as:
    
       ./run_JAABA_linux.sh /mathworks/home/application/v717
       
    If you have MATLAB installed in /mathworks/devel/application/matlab, 
    run the shell script as:
    
       ./run_JAABA_linux.sh /mathworks/devel/application/matlab
-MCRInstaller.zip
   -include when building component by clicking "Add MCR" link 
    in deploytool

4. Appendix 

A. Linux x86-64 systems:
   On the target machine, add the MCR directory to the environment variable 
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH by issuing the following commands:

        NOTE: <mcr_root> is the directory where MCR is installed
              on the target machine.         

            setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH
                $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
                <mcr_root>/v717/runtime/glnxa64:
                <mcr_root>/v717/bin/glnxa64:
                <mcr_root>/v717/sys/os/glnxa64:
                <mcr_root>/v717/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64/native_threads:
                <mcr_root>/v717/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64/server:
                <mcr_root>/v717/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64 
            setenv XAPPLRESDIR <mcr_root>/v717/X11/app-defaults


     
        NOTE: To make these changes persistent after logout on Linux 
              or Mac machines, modify the .cshrc file to include this  
              setenv command.
        NOTE: The environment variable syntax utilizes forward 
              slashes (/), delimited by colons (:).  
        NOTE: When deploying standalone applications, it is possible 
              to run the shell script file run_JAABA_linux.sh 
              instead of setting environment variables. See 
              section 2 "Files to Deploy and Package".
