classdef ExperimentCoordinator < handle
%ExperimentCoordinator Coordinate experiment selection across objects/plots.
%   An ExperimentCoordinator is a hub for two-way sending/receiving of
%   signals. Objects and/or plots may register with the coordinator to
%   listen to the signals. They may call a method on the coordinator to
%   send a signal. The signal is received by all listeners.
%
%   Typically, the signals used by OlyDat are vectors of experimentIDs,
%   representing the current experiments that are selected or under
%   consideration. The typical usage is, plots send signals when clicked,
%   and when plots receive a signal, they update themselves to highlight
%   the selected experiments.
%
%   Note that listeners that register with the Coordinator must remember to
%   unregister when those listeners cease to exist. Failure to do this will
%   likely lead to errors as the Coordinator attempts to call code on stale
%   objects.
%
%   See also OlyDat.Plot, OlyDat.Plot/doPlot, OlyDat.Browser.
    
% TODO: Can probably make unregistration optional for registered axes if
% this turns out to be a hassle.
