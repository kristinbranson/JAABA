<h1> Post Processing Predictions </h1>
</center>

<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>Prediction and the scores produced by classifiers are not always smooth and
sometimes can result in bouts that are shorter than normal behavioral bouts.
In addition to improving the classifier by adding such examples to the training
set, JAABA gives user post-processing tools to smooth the predictions.
</p>
<p> The post-processing tool can be accessed by <b>Classifier -> Post-Processing</b>.</p>

<h3> Types of Post-Processing </h3>

The predictions can be smoothed by filtering or by hysteresis.

<h4> Filtering </h4>
Filtering smooths the predictions by convolving the scores (and not the
predictions) with a rectangular window which gives the current
frame's a score is the mean of the frames in the window around it. The
predictions is then done by thresholding the scores at 0. The size of the window
is set by the user.

<h4> Hysteresis </h4>
Hysteresis smooths the predictions by going through all the predicted bouts of the
behavior and discarding all the bouts that don't have any frame that get a
scores about <i>htresh</i>. It then goes through all the bouts of none (or
not-behavior) and discards all the bouts that don't have any frames with scores
less than <i>lthresh</i>. The parameters <i>hthresh</i> and  <i>hthresh</i> are
set by the user.

<h3> Ignoring small bouts </h3>

In addition, to above smoothing methods, user can also set the minimum bout
length to ignore bouts that have length smaller than the minimum bout length.
