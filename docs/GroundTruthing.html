<h1><a href="index.html">JAABA</a>: Ground Truthing </h1>

<p>
JAABA's ground-truthing mode is designed to quantitatively measure the classifier's performance.
The classifier's performance is measured by its accuracy at predicting the behavior class for frames
it was not trained on. To do this, the user manually labels a random selection of frames without 
looking at the classifier's predictions on these frames. These labels are used as the <b>ground truth</b> 
against which the classifier's predictions are compared. Note that these labels are not added to training set.

<h2><a id="Starting">Starting JAABA in Ground-Truthing Mode</a></h2>

<p>To start JAABA in ground-truthing mode, in the inital <b>Edit Files</b> dialog that is displayed
immediately after starting JAABA, selecting the desired projcet, then select
<b>Ground Truthing</b> as the <b>Labeling Mode</b> in the initial. After selecting
ground-truthing mode, add experiments for which you would like to check
the classifier's performance and then click Done.

<h2><a id="Classifier">Selecting the Classifier</a></h3>

<p>The classifier on which you want to compute the performance can be loaded at the
initial gui using the <b>Load w/o exps</b> button. This will load the classifier but
not the experiments that were used to train the classifier. The classifier can
also be loaded later using <b>File -> Load Classifier -> without experiments</b>. 
</p>

<p> Alternatively, if you have already produced predictions using the desired classifier for the
experiments you want to ground truth, you can instead load these scores into JAABA. This can be
done in the main JAABA interface by selecting the menu item <b>File -> Load Scores</b>. If the scores 
are not saved at the default location then you'll have to load scores individually for each experiment. If
both the classifier and scores are loaded then the performance is computed for the loaded classifier.
</p>

<hr class="h2-divider">

<h2><a id="Labeling">Labeling in Ground-Truthing Mode</a></h2>

<p> In ground-truthing mode, you can label trajectories for flies as you
would in the normal training mode. These labels are used as the <b>ground truth</b> against which
the classifier's predictions are compared. If the ground-truthing mode is started in
advanced mode (recommended), JAABA provides <b>5 buttons</b> to label behavior: <b>Important [Behavior]</b>,
<b>[Behavior]</b>, <b>Important None</b>, <b>None</b> and <b>Unknown</b>.</p>

<p>Frames that are clearly the behavior or clearly not the behavior should be labeled as 
<b>Important [Behavior]</b> and <b>Important None</b>, respectively. A high error rate on these <b>important</b>
frames would cause you to be reluctant to use the classifier.</p>

<p> Frames in which the behavior or not-behavior is somewhat present but are on border should
be labeled as <b>[Behavior]</b> and <b>None</b>. These are frames for which either the user
is not confident in the behavior class or frames for which there are other reasons the classifier
might find the frame difficult (e.g. tracking is poor for that frame). The user is less demanding 
about classifier's performance and would be satisified if the classifier got these mostly right.
</p>

<p> If JAABA is started in normal ground-truthing mode, only 3 buttons are
provided: <b>[Behavior]</b>, <b>None</b> and <b>Unknown</b>. Frames labeled as 
<b>[Behavior]</b> and <b>None</b> are treated as <b>Important [Behavior]</b> and 
<b>Important None</b> while reporting the ground-truth performance. </p>

<hr class="h2-divider">

<h2><a id="SelectingFrames">Selecting Frames to Ground Truth</a></h2>

<p>
To get an accurate estimate of JAABA's performance, we suggest using an unbiased method 
to choose frames to label. JAABA provides 2 methods to randomly select frames for labeling. 
<ul>
<li><b>Random</b>: The user can ask JAABA to suggest random intervals to label by selecting
<b>View->Ground Truth Suggestion -> Random</b>. The user is prompted for the size of the interval and the
number of such intervals. Then, JAABA randomly selects such intervals for the user to label.</li>
<li><b>Balanced Random</b>: For behaviors that occur rarely, if frames are selected randomly, there will be
very few positive frames to label. Thus, the number of frames that the user needs to label to obtain an 
accurate estimate of the false negative rate will be quite large. In such cases, users can select 
<b>View-> Ground Truth Suggestion - Balanced Random</b>. As with Random, this will ask the user for the 
size of the interval and the number of intervals per experiment. However, in <b>Balanced Random</b>, 
JAABA selects intervals to label randomly, but increases the weight of intervals that contain predicted
positive frames. The weight of a given interval is the sum of the weights of its constituent frames, and 
the weights of individual frames are set so that the total weight of predicted positive and predicted 
negative examples is the same. To use this method of suggestion, the scores must already be computed
and loaded for all the movies.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The suggested intervals are shown by a <b>cyan line</b> below the manual label
timeline. The <b>Switch Target</b> interface gives information about the number of
frames that have been suggested by JAABA for each animal. To search for the suggested intervals,
users can set the <b>Shift + Arrow</b> keys to jump to suggested intervals by selecting the menu item
<b>Go-> Navigation Preferences</b>, then setting <b>Shift + Arrows jumps to ..</b> to
<b>Ground Truth Suggestions</b>.

<hr class="h2-divider">

<h2><a id="Performance">Ground Truth Performance</a></h2>

<p> After labeling ground truth, the user can get a measure of the classifier's accuracy on
the ground-truth labels by selecting the menu item 
<b>Classifier-> Compute Ground Truth Performance</b>. If a
classifier is loaded then JAABA will use the classifier's predictions to compute
the performance. If the scores are loaded then they are used to compute the
performance. If both scores and classifier are loaded in, then JAABA uses scores
to compute the performance. JAABA will return a table showing the types of errors made.</p>
<center><a href="images/CVOut.png"><img src="images/GTPerformance.png"></a><br>
<i>Screen capture of the ground-truth accuracy table</i></center>

<p>The <b>columns</b> of the table correspond to the classifiers' <b>predictions</b>, 
and the <b>rows</b> correspond to the <b>manual labels</b>. Each element of the table corresponds
to the number and (percent) of frames with the given type of manual labels that have the given prediction.
Percentages are computed over rows. </p>
<p>The columns are:
<ol>
<li> <b>[Behavior] Predicted</b>: Frames predicted as the project behavior, <i>Chase</i> in the 
example table below.</li>
<li> <b>Not Predicted</b>: Depending on the classifier parameters set, some frames may not be predicted
on. This will happen for frames whose scores lie between the scores threshold that are set using 
<b>Classifier -> Set confidence thresholds</b>. These thresholds are both by default 0, thus
there is a prediction for each frame and the middle column should be all zeros.  </li>
<li> <b>None Predicted</b>: Frames predicted as not the behavior.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>The rows are:
<ol>
<li><b>[Behavior] Important</b>: Frames that were labeled as important examples of the behavior (<i>Chase</i> below). 
<li><b>[Behavior]</b>: Frames that were labeled as the behavior (<i>e.g. Chase</i>), regardless of
their importance.<li>
<li><b>None Important</b>: Frames that were labeled as important examples of not the behavior.</li>
<li><b>None All</b>: Frames that were labeled as not the behavior, regardless of their importance.</li>
</ol>

<hr class="h2-divider">

<h2><a id="Viewing">Viewing Predictions</a></h2>

<p>By default, classifier's predictions are hidden so that they don't bias the
users labeling. If the user wants to see the predictions for some reason (e.g. to make sure that the 
correct files are loaded in), they can select <b>View -> Show Predictions</b>.
</p>

<hr class="h2-divider">

<h2><a id="Saving">Saving Labels</a></h2>

The user can save the ground-truth labels by selecting the menu item <b>File->Save Labels</b>. This will save the
labels to the <b>ground-truth label file</b> specified during the project setup by 
<b>Ground Truth Label File Name</b>. The saved labels can be used 
to measure the performance of a different classifier (for the same project and behavior) later. We,
however, recommend not to test ground-truth too often as this may cause the
user to select a classifier that over-fits to the ground-truth labels.
