<center><h1> Installation and Starting JAABA</h1></center>

<h3> REQUIREMENTS </h3>

Linux (64-bit), Windows (32- or 64-bit), or MAC (64-bit) systems with at least
4GB RAM. JAABA uses parallel computation, and will be faster on multicore
machines. If you are running JAABA in Matlab using the source code, then you will
<b>require</b> Parallel Computation Toolbox. JAABA is a computationally intensive program, and would work better on more powerful machine.

<h3> INSTALLATION </h3>

<p>Download the JAABA packwage for you system from
<a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jaaba/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jaaba/</a>. 

<p><!-- Copy the JAABA folder from USB pen drives. Running the executables from
the USB pen drive is slow and also might cause errors. This folder contains the
program, the sample data and this documentation.--> The executables are compiled Matlab programs and do not require Matlab, but require the Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR)</p>

<p>Install the Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR) for R2012a. <a
href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html"> MCR installers
and the instructions </a> are available at Mathworks website.</p> You don't need
MCR if you'll run JAABA in Matlab from the source code.

<h3> STARTING UP </h3>

On Windows: From JAABA/Win32 or JAABA/Win64 folders depending on your system, run the executable JAABA_win.exe <br>

On 64-bit MAC: From JAABA/MAC64, run run_JAABA_mac.command file. Do <b>not</b> run the <b>JAABA_mac</b> appication.<br>

On 64-bit Linux: From JAABA/Linux64, run the run_JAABA_linux.sh file from the command line in a terminal. You need to give the path to installed MCR as the argument. <br>

From source code in Matlab: Change directory to JAABAROOT/perframe and run
StartJAABA.m <br>

<p>Loading the MCR is slow, and hence once you run the executable it may take
some time for JAABA to appear.</p>
