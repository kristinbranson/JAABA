<h1> Plotting <a href="index.html">JAABA</a>'s output </h1>

<br>
<p>After importing data with PrepareJAABAData, and training a classifier
with StartJAABA, one can then classify and visualize large data sets with

<h2><a id="LoadingExperiments">Loading Experiments</a></h2>

<p>
Multiple experiments can be divided into an arbitrary number of groups for
multi-variate analysis.  Use the "New" button to create a new group and
give it a name, then the "Add" button to browse directories for experiments.
Remove selected experiments with the "Delete" button.  Deleting all of the
experiments in a group will also delete the group.  Transfer experiments from
one group to another with the "Move" button.  Designate loaded experiments
to analyze by selecting (a subset of) them with <shift/ctrl> left button.
</p>

<p>
The features analyzed are only those common to all of the current experiments.
</p>

<p>
Experiment lists and other settings are maintained from one session to
the next by automatically saving the configuration to disk when exiting
("most_recent_config.mat").  Multiple different configurations can be
maintained using the "Load" and "Save" buttons.  The "Reset" button deletes
all groups and experiments and returns all settings to their defaults.
</p>

<hr class="h2-divider">

<h2><a id="LoadingClassifiers">Loading Classifiers</a></h2>

<p>A set of classifiers to be applied to the above experiments are specified
with the "Add" button.  Remove selected classifers with the "Delete" button.
Use the "Classify" button to apply the classifiers to the data.  An option
in the contextual menu on this button permits one to either classify only
the data not already classified.
</p>

<hr class="h2-divider">

<h2><a id="BehaviorStatistics">Behavior Statistics</a></h2>

<p>
Create bar charts of the fraction of time each behavior is performed using the
"Behavior Bar Chart" button.  A contextual menu on the "Behavior Bar Chart"
button controls whether averages are done on a per-fly or per-frame basis.
</p>

<p>
Logical combinations of behaviors can be analyzed using the pull-down menu
in the "Behavior" box to the left.  So for example, if "And" "Behavior <X>"
is chosen, then the bars in the panels show the fraction of time when each
behavior and Behavior <X> are performed simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
Plots for just a single individual or a specific sex can be chosen using
the pull-down mneu in the "Individual" box.  If "All" is specified here,
then all individuals from the experiments selected in the "Experiments"
box are analyzed.
</p>

<p>
The table is filled with the p-values from K-S normality tests and two-sided
t-tests and Wilcoxen rank sum tests.
</p>

<p>
The fraction of time a selected behavior is performed as a function of time
during the experiment can be plotted using the "Behavior Time Series" button.
A contextual menu controls whether error bars are plotted or per-experiment
data overlayed.  Flies are first pooled within an experiment and then combined
across experiments according to the central tendency and dispersion measures
specified in a shared contextual menu on the "Prefs" button.  The experiment
groups are color coded to match that in text of the group pull-down menu.
</p>

<hr class="h2-divider">

<h2><a id="FeatureStatistics">Feature Statistics</a></h2>

<p>
Histograms of feature values during behaviors of interest can be created by
selecting the desired behavior, feature, and individuals using the pull-down
menus on the left and clicking on the "Feature Histogram" button.  As with
behavior statistics, the experiment groups are color coded, a contextual
menu controls the the specific calculations, and logical operations on
behaviors can be performed.
</p>

<p>
A time series of feature values can be plotted with the "Feature Time
Series" button.  Colors and contextual buttons are as before, but not logical
operators.  The time axis can either be absolute time during the experiment,
or relative to the beginning or end of a bout of the specified behavior.
</p>

<hr class="h2-divider">

<h2><a id="InterestingDifferences">Interesting Differences</a></h2>

<p>
Create a table of behavior-feature pairs whose feature histograms are most
different using the "Interesting Feature Histograms" button.  The metric used
is the difference in the means normalized by the combined standard deviations
(i.e. d-prime of signal detection theory).  Differences between both during
versus not-during the behavior, as well as during the behavior for each
possible pair of groups are considered.  Selecting a cell in the table changes
the "Behavior" and "Feature" boxes and plots the corresponding histograms.
A contextual menu provides options to include or exclude Nan and Inf d-primes.
</p>

<p>
These calculations take a (really long) time and so the results are cached
to disk.
