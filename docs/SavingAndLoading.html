<h3> Saving Labels and Classifiers </h3>

<p>The labels can be saved using <b>File -> Save Labels</b>. The labels for all
the experiments get saved in the experiment directory with the name that
specified in the configuration file (value of the file.labelfilename parameter). The saved labels
are automatically loaded when the experiment is used with the same project in a
new JAABA session. If you add the same experiment, but select a different
project, labels for the current project won't be loaded.
</p>

<p>Similarly, <b>File -> Save classifier and labels</b> will save the current
classifier and the labels. The labels are saved to their default location. For
the classifier, JAABA will ask for a location to save it. A
saved classifier can be loaded using the <b>Load</b> and <b>Load w/o exps</b>
buttons when starting a new JAABA session. <b>Load</b> will load the classifier
alongwith with movies/experiments that were used to train the classifier while <b>Load w/o
exps</b> loads the classifier without any of the experiments.
</p>

<h3> Predicting on Whole Movies</h3>

<p>After training a classifier, the whole trajectory of a animal, the whole
experiment, or all the experiments can be classified by <b>Classifier ->
Classify</b>. <b>Current animal</b> computes the predictions for the whole
trajectory of the current animal. <b> Current Experiment -> Don't Save</b>
computes the predictions for all the animals in the current experiment but does
not save the prediction results (scores). <b> Current Experiment -> Save to default</b> saves the 
scores in the experiment directory to the file specified by the
file.scorefilename parameter in the project configuration. <b>Current Experiment
-> Save to different </b> asks the user for a location to save the scores.  You
can also predict on all the experiments without saving using <b>All
Experiments-> Don't Save</b>. <b>All Experiments -> Save to default</b> saves
the scores to the scores file specified by file.scorefilename in the projects
configuration. <b>All Experiments -> Save to different </b> will ask for a score
file name to save the scores. The scores are saved in the experiment directory.
</p>

<p> The predictions computed using <b>Current Experiment</b> and <b>All
Experiments</b> are shown at the bottom of the prediction timeline (the <b>Loaded</b> option in the
drop down menu).  </p>

<p> Previously saved scores can be loaded using <b>File -> Load Scores -> For
current experiment from default location</b> or <b>For all experiments from
default location</b>. Other options in <b>File -> Load Scores</b>
can be used to load saved scores from non-default locations.  </p>
