<center><h1> Navigating within and between Videos </h1></center>
<br>

<p>

Within the main JAABA interface, there are several methods for navigating in <a href="#Time">time</a> and space within a video, <a href="#SwitchTarget">between different animals</a> in the same video, and <a href="#SwitchTarget">between different videos</a>. This will allow you to easily find new, informative frames to label and evaluate the performance of the current classifier. </p>

<center><img src="images/JLabelStart1.png" width="743" height="562"></center>

<p>In the Movie Previewer, the animal that is selected for annotation is highlighted by a thicker outline. For the selected animal, we also plot the locations for the past and future frames.
</p>

<hr class="h2-divider">

<h2> <a id="Time">Navigating in Time</a></h2>

<ul>
<li> The <b>Left</b> and <b>Right</b> arrow keys let you navigate forward or backward
by a single frame.</li>
<li>The <b>Down</b> and <b>Up</b> arrow keys move the video forward and
backward by 30 frames (the number of frames can be modified). </li>
<li> The <b>slider</b> below the Movie Previewer can also be used to change the current video frame. </li>
<li> Clicking on the selected animal's <b>plotted trajectory</b> will move the video to the selected frame. </li>
<li> The <b>Play</b> button below the Movie Previewer plays the movie. You can set the movie playback speed using <b> View -> Preview Options.. </b></li>
<li> The current frame number is shown in the <b>text box</b> next to the play button. Editing this textbox will change the current frame. </li>
<li> Clicking on the <b>timelines</b> will move the current frame to the selected frame.</li>
</ul>

<!--- TODO: This should be moved to a general introduction to the main GUI --->
<p>The current frame is indicated in the timelines below the Movie Previewer by a vertical yellow line. 
Timelines: 
<ul>
<li>The top timeline shows the <b>manually annotated labels</b>.</li>
<li>The middle timeline shows the <b>automatic predictions</b>.</li>
<li>The bottom timeline shows the values of the <b>per-frame feature(s)</b> selected in the drop down menu to its left. Additional perframe timelines can be added by clicking the <b>+</b> button. 
</ul>
</p>

<hr class="h2-divider">

<h2><a id="SwitchTarget">Switching to Different Animals and Videos</a></h2>

There are two ways to switch which animal is currently being annotated.
<ul>
<li>For animals in the same video, you can <b>double-click</b> that animal's plotted position to switch to that animal. </li>
<li> You can switch to animals in the same or different videos using the <b>Go -> Switch Target</b> menu. This brings up a table that gives detailed information about each animal, including how many frames of each category have been labeled and predicted for the animal. To switch animals in this interface, select any cell in the row of that animal and click <b>Switch to Target</b>.
</li>
</ul>

<!--- TODO: This should be moved to a general introduction to the main GUI --->
<p>The information about the animal being annotated is shown on the right side. </p>

<center><img src="images/SwitchTarget.png" height="562"></center>

<hr class="h2-divider">

<h2> <a id="Space">Navigating in Space</a> </h2>

<ul>
<li> The <b>Zoom-in</b>, <b>Zoom-out</b>, and <b>Pan</b> buttons above the Movie Previewer can be used to manually change the field of view.</li>
<li> To keep the animal being annotated within the Movie Previewer while changing the field of view as little as possible, select <b>View -> Zoom -> Keep target in view </b>. <i>Recommended.</i></li>
<li> To keep the animal being annotated at the center of the Movie Previewer, select <b>View -> Zoom -> Center axes on current target</b>.</li>
<li> To keep the field of view static, select <b>View -> Zoom -> Static View</b>. In this mode, the animal being annotated may go outside the field of view. </li>
</ul>

<hr class="h2-divider">

<h2> <a id="Advanced">Advanced Navigation</a></h2>

<p>To navigate the movie in ways other than simply moving forward and backward
in time, you can use left and right arrow keys with <b>control</b> (or
		<b>command</b> on MAC) and <b>shift</b> modifier keys.
<b>Control</b> (or <b>command</b>) modifier keys takes you to the start of the
next manually labeled bouts or the end of the previous labeled bout.
<b>Shift</b> lets you navigate in multiple ways, which you can select using
the <b>Go -> Navigation Preferences</b>. <b> Bouts in current scores </b>
takes you to the beginning and end of bouts in the predictions, <b>Errors in
current scores</b> takes you to beginnings and ends of bouts of errors i.e.,
		frames where the predictions do not match the labels, <b>Errors in
		validated scores</b> takes you to validation errors, <b> Low
		Confidence </b> takes you to bouts of low confidence predictions.
		The confidence thresholds can be set using <b>Classifier -> Set
		Confidence Thresholds</b>. The predictions for frames that have low
		confidence are not shown in the automatic predictions timeline.
		Using <b>Thresholds on perframe</b> you can select a perframe
		feature and set a threshold and then navigate to frames where the
		perframe features is either greater than or less than the threshold
		value.</p>

<p>Also, in the <b>Navigation Preferences</b> you can select how many frames are jumped when using the up and down arrow keys (<b>N. frames jump</b>). You can select which bouts to jump to using the <b>shift</b> and <b>control</b> modifier keys. For example, if you select only chase in <b>Seek to next/previous</b> then <b>control</b> will jump just to the chase bouts.</p>
