% CURVSPACE Evenly spaced points along an existing curve in 2D or 3D.
%   CURVSPACE(P,N) generates N points that interpolates a curve
%   (represented by a set of points) with an equal spacing. Each
%   row of P defines a point, which means that P should be a n x 2
%   (2D) or a n x 3 (3D) matrix.

%   (Example)
%   x = -2*pi:0.5:2*pi;
%   y = 10*sin(x);
%   z = linspace(0,10,length(x));
%   N = 50;
%   p = [x',y',z'];

function l = distance(x,y)

% DISTANCE Calculate the distance.
%   DISTANCE(X,Y) calculates the distance between two
%   points X and Y. X should be a 1 x 2 (2D) or a 1 x 3 (3D)
%   vector. Y should be n x 2 matrix (for 2D), or n x 3 matrix
%   (for 3D), where n is the number of points. When n > 1,
%   distance between X and all the points in Y are returned.

%   (Example)
%   x = [1 1 1];
%   y = [1+sqrt(3) 2 1];
